### Features
* OpenAPI integration. Studio will use the OpenAPI spec from Hono-Zod-OpenAPI apps to map spec definitions to your api routes. Docs for a route are shown in a new "Docs" tab.
* Basic Command bar. You can now toggle the timeline or logs with the command bar (`cmd+k`), as well as switch between different tabs (Body, Headers, Params, Docs) in the request fields.
* Natural language request generation. You can now generate requests with an instruction prompt. Press `cmd+shift+g` to open the prompt input.

### Bug fixes
* Added a tooltip to the sidebar panel toggle to make it clearer what the keyboard shortcut is (`cmd+b`)
* Fixed an issue where the route side bar would not highlight the currently selected route after you switched the method manually
* Fixed an issue where the request body would not load correctly from local history
