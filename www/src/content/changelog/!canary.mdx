### Features

- **Rendering outside requests** External requests are now rendered in the request panel, instead of the timeline panel.

- **Improved AI request generation** We've added some static analysis smarts for wrangler projects in order to give LLM providers more context about the code that powers each route.

- **Improved Route Updating** We've added some improvements to how we refresh your list of API routes in the Studio.

- **Render audio files** When your api returns a binary audio response, we will render an audio player for you to listen to it.

- **Compact AI query generation prompts** Using latest model from Antrhopic, we were able to achieve a significant token reduction in the query generation prompts. Only affects Claude 3.5 Sonnet for now.

### Bug fixes

- **D1 autoinstrumentation** The client library, `@fiberplane/hono-otel`, now instruments D1 queries in latest versions of wrangler/miniflare.

- **Set response attributes** Fixed an issue where setting response attributes would not work correctly (for synchronous endpoints).

- **Side panel not closing** Fixed an issue where the side panel would not close when clicking outside of it.

- **Missing log information** Fixed an issue where logs would not be displayed fully in the logs panel.

- **Render images returned from API** Fixed an issue where images returned from an API request made through Studio would not be rendered in the response panel.
