Studio works with a companion client library, `@fiberplane/hono-otel`.
When used together, Studio can show you not only the response of each HTTP request,
but the entire trace of the request-response lifecycle: Timing, application logs, exceptions, and more.

### Navigating to the request trace page

To inspect request traces, navigate to the "Requests" tab in the Studio UI.
This will show you a list of all the requests that have been made to your API.
Select the request you want to see the trace for.

You can jump up or down the request overview using the caret buttons at the top right of the page or simply pressing keys <KeyboardButton>j</KeyboardButton> and <KeyboardButton>k</KeyboardButton>.

Hit <KeyboardButton>esc</KeyboardButton> to close the trace details view and return to the request list.

Alternatively, after you [make a request](/docs/features/making-requests) through Studio, you can click "Go to Trace Details" to see the trace for that request.

## Summary

At the top of the page, you will see a summary of the trace. It will show either the body of the response, or a list of errors that occurred during the request.

## Timeline

The request timeline gives you visual sense of how long each of the steps in the request-response lifecycle took to complete.
The entire lifecycle of the request is shown at the top, and any actions, cascading requests,
or other events that occur during the request are shown nested underneath.
You can click on any of these events to see more details about the event on the right side.

## Details

The details panel shows all of the most important information of the request-response lifecycle from when the request is received (including its headers, query parameters, and body) to when the response is sent back to the client.
Outgoing network requests made by the API are also shown here, as well as any errors or logs produced during the request.

Details view will render the output in best effort mode. By default, the output is rendered as plain text.
If the output is a JSON object, it will be rendered in a foldable tree JSON view.
For some vendors, like Neon, we are able to extract and display the final SQL query that gets run on the database.
