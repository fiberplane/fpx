In the [last blog post](https://fiberplane.com/blog/asynchronous-tasks-in-cloudflare-part2/), I demonstrated how to decompose the sign-up and send-mail functions into two separate workers. 
One reason was to use Cloudflare Queues to scale the Workers logically independently. 

Thanks to [Harshil](https://x.com/harshil1712) from Cloudflare, I recently learned that it's also possible to scale up different functions within a single worker if they use a Queue. 
Meaning you can include the code of your Producer and Consumer into the same worker and they execute separately.

Coming from a service-oriented mindset, this was mind-blowing and new to me, and I'm still quite amazed by it. So let's break it down. 

## How does this work
Every worker in Cloudflare is single-threaded. 
When a worker produces a message to a Queue and the same worker also implements a consumer to handle the message, Cloudflare handles concurrency and makes sure each message get processed by scalling up the workers automatically.
This mechanism allows you to scale up different functions within a single worker.

## Example
Let's move the code back into a single worker and implement newsletter functionality for all signed-up users. This functionality will retrieve all existing users from the database and send them newsletters using our `sendMail` function. Instead of calling the function directly from the index.tsx file, we send a message for each database entry to the Queue. In addition, we implement in the same worker a consumer that will handle the messages in batches from the Queue.

When a worker produces a message to a Queue and implements a consumer, Cloudflare will automatically scale up the worker when needed. This means our worker can scale horizontally based on the Queue's workload.

## Implementation
Make sure to include the Queue bindings in your `wrangler.toml` file for both consumer and producer, and add the Binding to your index.tsx file.

Now let's add a endpoint to send a newsletter, get the database entries and produce a message for each entry to the Queue.

```typescript, title="index.tsx"
app.post("/api/send-newsletter", async (c) => {
    const { newsletterText, subject } = await c.req.json();
    
    // Connect to the database
    const sql = neon(c.env.DATABASE_URL);
    const db = drizzle(sql);
  
    // Fetch all registered users
    const allUsers = await db.select().from(runners);
    
    // Send newsletter to each user
    for (const user of allUsers) {
      try {
      console.log(`Sending message to queue for user: ${user.firstName} (${user.email})`);
        await c.env.NEWSLETTER_QUEUE.send({
          email: user.email,
          firstName: user.firstName,
          newsletterText,
          subject,
          type: 'newsletter'
        });
      } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to send newsletter to ${user.email}:`, error);
      }
    }

    return c.json({ 
    message: `Newsletter queued for ${allUsers.length} recipients`,
    status: "success" 
    });
});
```
Next we need to implement a queue handler within the same worker to send out the emails. 

```typescript, title="index.tsx"
export default {
  fetch: instrument(app).fetch,
  async queue(batch: MessageBatch<any>, env: Bindings): Promise<void> {
    console.log(`Processing batch of ${batch.messages.length} messages`);
    for (const message of batch.messages) {
      const { email, firstName, type, newsletterText, subject } = message.body;
      try {
        if (type === 'newsletter') {
            await sendNewsletterMail(email, env.RESEND_API, firstName, newsletterText, subject);
        } else {
            await sendMail(email, env.RESEND_API, firstName);
        }
        message.ack();
        console.log(`Successfully sent ${type || 'signup'} email to ${firstName} (${email})`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to send email to ${email}:`, error);
          message.retry();
      }
    }
  }
};
``` 


The number of messages in a batch and other Queue parameters can be configured in the `wrangler.toml` file. For more details about Queue configuration, check out the [previous blog post](/blog/2025-01-17-asynchronous-tasks-in-cloudflare-part2) in this series.

## Conclusion
Cloudflare Queues provide a powerful way to scale different functions within a single worker. By producing messages to a Queue and implementing a consumer in the same worker, you can achieve horizontal scaling while maintaining your code in a monolithic codebase.
So while it might seem counterintuitive at first, combining Producer and Consumer code in one Worker is a legitimate pattern when using Cloudflare Queues, as the platform handles the separation of concerns at runtime through its instance creation mechanism.

However, there are still valid reasons to split your code into multiple workers:
- Independent deployability of services
- Separation of concerns
- Team organization, especially when different teams are responsible for different services
- Resource isolation and fine-grained scaling control

The choice between a single worker with Queues or multiple workers depends on your specific needs and organizational structure.
