For developers building TypeScript APIs, the power of Hono is the bet many are taking.
It’s blazing fast, lightweight, designed explicitly for edge and serverless, and integrates
incredibly well with OpenAPI via their [official package](https://hono.dev/examples/hono-openapi) and
[Rhinobase](https://github.com/rhinobase/hono-openapi).
Just last week, [the latest version release](https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.7.0) included new
middleware features and a fresh schema validator - all enhancements that continue to make Hono
the choice for modern web developers.

Hono is our TypeScript framework of choice - we love it so much we created the [HONC stack](https://honc.dev/) to make
it as easy as possible for developers to try it out. While the OpenAPI functionality is powerful, we dreamed of a
simplified UI that makes this seamlessly automated for developers. A place where you can generate the docs, routes,
and tests all within one interface.

That’s why we built the Fiberplane [**API Playground for Hono**](https://github.com/fiberplane/fiberplane), designed to
give developers a native UX for exploring and testing their Hono service APIs.

### Your Hono.js API available to spec in under a minute

Leveraging OpenAPI, the explorer generates values, types, and documentation and more:

- Easily install the Playground through pluggable middleware
- Access built-in interactive documentation
- Automatically discover routes via OpenAPI spec and show these as human-readable CRUD operations
- Generate a request to test endpoints in real-time
- Add authentication headers and reuse these throughout requests
- Quickly navigate with keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Switch between beautiful themes for light and dark mode

### Getting Started

The Fiberplane Playground is available as middleware that you can install as follows:

<PackageManagers type="install" pkg="@fiberplane/hono" />


sadsad

```tsx
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { createFiberplane } from "@fiberplane/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.use(
  "/fp/*",
  createFiberplane({
    openapi: { url: "/openapi.json" },
  }),
);

### The first step toward better Hono APIs and Cloudflare Worker debugging

As the way we build and deploy modern APIs evolve, and more developers adopt edge-first and performant tooling,
we see the future in the power of Hono.js and Cloudflare. This initial API playground creates an easy interface to spin up new,
top-quality APIs. The next step in our roadmap is a tool for better testing, tracing, and prompts to build.

We’re releasing new features in the next couple of sprints.

### It’s alpha - here’s what’s in progress

Just a few disclaimers while you are using the API Playground
* For now the Playground is a bit of a purist, so JSON is the only supported format. Multipart/form-data is coming soon.
* Websockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE) are on the roadmap but not live yet.
* An OpenAPI spec is required. You've got two options: craft it yourself like a hand-coded masterpiece, or let AI generate it for you from your API code.

The Fiberplane Hono Playground is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fiberplane/fiberplane).
