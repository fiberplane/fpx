Recently we needed some example apps to showcase how to build a HONC app with Fiberplane
Studio for our November Honcathon, so I decided to build [Honcanator][0]: The AI goose generator.

The example app is pretty simple and uses a standard HONC setup (Hono, Drizzle, Neon, and Cloudflare Workers).

To create and store images, we also needed to use two Cloudflare services:

* Cloudflare R2 as object storage (_like AWS S3_)
* Cloudflare AI to generate images

Let's take a quick look at how I've built this app.

## Configuring the basics

In order to use Cloudflare services like R2 and AI, we have to configure some additional Cloudflare bindings in our Worker.
That is as simple as editing the `wrangler.toml`:

```toml ins={8-13} title="wrangler.toml"
name = "honc-neon-template"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-28"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]

[observability]
enabled = true

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "R2_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "geese"

[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

Then we can add it to our bindings in Hono:

```ts ins={3-4} title="src/index.ts"
type Bindings = {
  DATABASE_URL: string;
  R2_BUCKET: R2Bucket;
  AI: Ai;
};
```

The `R2Bucket` and `AI` types are Cloudflare special types which will give you a typed
interface for interacting with these services.

## Routes

The majority of our routes were simple CRUD routes which simply query the database and return
some stuff from it so I won't bore you with the boring part, lets get to the actual interesting
route: The creation endpoint.

The first few lines of the `POST /api/geese/:name` route are simply a check to see whenever
a goose with that name already exists.

```ts title="src/index.ts" {7-11}
app.get("/api/geese/:name", async (c) => {
  const { name } = c.req.param();

  const sql = neon(c.env.DATABASE_URL);
  const db = drizzle(sql);

  const goose = await db.select().from(geese).where(eq(geese.name, name));

  if (goose.length === 0) {
    return c.json({ error: "doesnt_exist" }, 404);
  }
  //...
})
```

After those checks are done, we get to the really
interesting part: Making geese!

## Image generation

This is where Cloudflare really shines. Creating an image is as simple
as three lines of code:

```ts title="src/index.ts" 
const model = "@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-1-schnell" as BaseAiTextToImageModels;
const prompt = `Please generate a image of a goose. Its name is ${name}. Make it in the style of comic or anime please`;

const response = await c.env.AI.run(model, {
  prompt,
});
```

The list of models available on Cloudflare AI can be found [here][1]. The list of image
generation models is pretty small at the moment, there is currently a few Stable Diffusion
models and [Flux-1-Schnell](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/flux-1-schnell/) model, which we are using in this example.

The response from the AI call comes back as a base64 encoded string, so we'll
use the built-in Node.js `Buffer` to get something that we can work with:

```ts title="src/index.ts" 
const base64image = response.image;
const buffer = Buffer.from(base64image, "base64");
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Don't mind the red squiggle">
Cloudflare Workers's types are a little funky at the moment for AI models, so the code above might show a red squiggly error line in your IDE. The issue is being tracked [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/2181).
</Aside>

## Saving to object storage

With our generated image now available to us as a `Buffer`, putting it into R2 is as simple
as writing one line of code:

```ts title="src/index.ts" 
await c.env.R2_BUCKET.put(`${name}.png`, buffer);
```

This shows how powerful the Hono bindings for Cloudflare are, we have just generated an
image and stored it in object storage with like 6 lines of code.

Retrieving it is as simple as:

```ts
const image = await c.env.R2_BUCKET.get(`${name}.png`);
```

which comes in handy for our `GET /api/geese/:name` route.

Using Fiberplane Studio, we can inspect the generated image for any of our geese and see a trace of the request, with the Neon database call and the call to R2, in the timeline.

## Parting words

In conclusion, making a small app which generates images and stores them in object storage
and a database really is no big feat with the HONC stack, which means you'll be able to build
powerful goose-themed apps in no time.

To wrap things up, the code for everything discussed in this blog post can be found
on GitHub, available for you to adapt and build upon how you wish:
