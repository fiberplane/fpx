# Fiberplane Studio

Welcome to the Fiberplane Studio monorepo!

## Description

This project has an api and a frontend that can consume telemetry data from a Hono app.

To connect your Hono app to the Studio api, you'll need to add the code in [`packages/client-library-otel`](./packages/client-library-otel) to your Hono app. You can do this via NPM, or linking to the local codebase. Please read [the client library README.md](./packages/client-library-otel/README.md) for instructions.

Worth noting is that the api connects to a local libsql (sqlite) database. Setup steps for this are simple (you just need to run migrations), and are in [api/README.md](./api/README.md).

The frontend is a React + Typescript + Tailwind app that uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. For more info on the frontend, see: [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md).

There are also folders containing:

- `fpx` - Rust code for production ingestion of telemetry data
- `packages/types` - The shared typescript types (and constants) used across the projects in the monorepo
- `webhonc`- A proxy service for sending requests to your Hono app from a static public url
- `www` - The documentation website for Studio


## Setup

Let's focus on running the api and frontend for now.

You'll want to

1. Run the code in this repo, and then
2. Add some client code to a Hono app

The next two sections take you through how to do this.

### Spinning up the database, api, and dashboard

1. Clone this repo
1. `cd api` and spin up the api (follow instructions in [api/README](./api/README.md))
1. Check the api is running on `http://localhost:8788`
1. `cd frontend` in a separate shell, and spin up the frontend (follow instructions in in [frontend/README](./frontend/README.md))
1. Check the frontend is running on `http://localhost:5173`

### Adding FPX to your Hono project

Follow the instructions in the [`client-library-otel` README](./packages/client-library-otel/README.md) to add FPX telemetry to your Hono project.

## Developing

This project uses typescript, biome and pnpm workspaces. Linting and formatting is handled with [biome](https://biomejs.dev/).

In the project root you can format all typescript codebases with `pnpm run format`.

You will also want to use the project root to prepare the npx command for the distributable API. See the root's `package.json` scripts, as well as the api's README for more details on testing the npx command.

Always publish with `pnpm publish`.

If you've updated the code in `packages/types`, you'll need to publish a new version of the package before publishing any other packages that depend on it.

### Generating Schemas / Types

The Rust types that will be used to generate the schemas are defined in `xtask/src/commands/schemas.rs`.

To generate the `frontend/src/schemas.ts` file, simply run `cargo xtask generate-schemas` in the project root directory.
